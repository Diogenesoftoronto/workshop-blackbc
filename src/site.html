        <h1>The Gift Card Lottery</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>We have 5 gift cards and we want to give the cards to 5 random students in this class. </p><i>How could we do that?</i>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>We can use a random number generator to generate a random number between 1 and 5. Then we can use a for loop to loop through the gift cards and assign each gift card to a random student.</p>

    <h2>The Code</h2>
    <p>We can use the following code to generate a random number between 1 and 5 in JavaScript:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
          // first we must create a function to do hold the code for our solution
          function randomStudent(arrayOfStudent, chance) {
              // second we must create a function to generate a random integer between 0 and (the amount of students in the class) - 1 
              const lotteryArray = [];
              const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * lotteryArray.length);

              // the ratio of null to students multiplied by one hundred should be the same as chance

              for (let i = 0; i < arrayOfStudent.length; i++) {
              }

            }
        </code>
    </pre>
