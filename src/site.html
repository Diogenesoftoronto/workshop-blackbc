        <h1>The Gift Card Lottery</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>We have 5 gift cards and we want to give the cards to 5 random students in this class. </p><i>How could we do that?</i>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>We can use a random number generator to generate a random number between 1 and 5. Then we can use a for loop to loop through the gift cards and assign each gift card to a random student.</p>

    <h2>The Code</h2>
    <p>We can use the following code to generate a random number between 1 and 5 in JavaScript:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
          // first we must create a function to do hold the code for our solution
          function lotteryWinner(arrayOfStudents, chance) {

            const amountOfStudents = arrayOfStudents.length

            const ratio = Math.floor(chance/100)

            const numberOfNulls = amountOfStudents/ratio;

            // the ratio of students to nulls (in the array) multiplied by one hundred should be the same as chance

            // copy array of students to the lottery array
            let lotteryArray = [...arrayOfStudents];

            // we have to create a loop that adds the nulls to the array
            while ((lotteryArray.length - amountOfStudents) < numberOfNulls) {lotteryArray.push(null)}
          
            // we must create a random integer between 0 and (the amount of students in the class) - 1 

            const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * lotteryArray.length);

            const winner = lotteryArray[randomNumber]
            
            return winner
          }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>We need a form for people to enter their name as a student. We also need someone to enter the chance that any student will win the lottery</p>
    <form action="site.html" method="post">
        <label for="studentName">Student Name</label>
        <input type="text" name="studentName" id="studentName">
        <label for="chance">Chance</label>
        <input type="number" name="chance" id="chance">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    <p> Now we can run the code to see who wins the gift card</p>
    <button type="action" class="lottery" onclick="lotteryWinner(students, chance)">Click to see the winner</button>
