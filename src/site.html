        <h1>The Gift Card Lottery</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>We have 5 gift cards and we want to give the cards to 5 random students in this class. </p><i>How could we do that?</i>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>We can use a random number generator to generate a random number between 1 and 5. Then we can use a for loop to loop through the gift cards and assign each gift card to a random student.</p>

    <h2>The Code</h2>
    <p>We can use the following code to generate a random number between 1 and 5 in JavaScript:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
          // first we must create a function to do hold the code for our solution
          function lotteryWinner(arrayOfStudents, chance) {
            const amountOfStudents = arrayOfStudents.length
            const ratio = Math.floor(chance/100)
            const numberOfNulls = amountOfStudents/ratio;
            // the ratio of students to nulls (in the array) multiplied by one hundred should be the same as chance
            // copy array of students to the lottery array
            let lotteryArray = [...arrayOfStudents];
            // we have to create a loop that adds that ratio to the array
            while ((lotteryArray.length - amountOfStudents) < numberOfNulls) {lotteryArray.push(null)}
          
            // we must create a random integer between 0 and (the amount of students in the class) - 1 
            const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * lotteryArray.length);
            const winner = lotteryArray[randomNumber]
            
            return winner
          }
          
          
        </code>
    </pre>
