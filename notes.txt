considering teaching or adding a css framework with bulma or bootstrap.

can expand workshop to add animations and more styles maybe an advanced section on that stuff.

Show the kids the advanced website and how far this can go and then live code with them a simpler version with just a button and tittle with some text maybe.

Make something inefficient and get them to simplify.

Have an open ended addition for them.

Have a function that is simple and have them advanded things to it. 

styling might be the most accessible part
